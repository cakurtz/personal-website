            <p>
                I am a software developer currently based in the Washington D.C. area.
                I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in December 2017.
                My passion in tech is to create fun and engaging mobile and web applications, along with APIs and micro-services for them to interact with.
                Some of my hobbies and interests include: astronomy, zoology, environmental conservation, nature, hiking, music, live concerts, and movies (especially Disney).
                The biggest issues I am passionate about include climate change, environmental conservation, LGBTQ+ rights, and equaliy.
